# EasyDI - Dependency Injection for Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lestard/EasyDI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lestard/EasyDI)

**EasyDI** is a small dependency injection (DI) library for java projects.

It's designed for small projects that don't need a full-blown DI-framework.
To be as easy as possible EasyDI has less features compared to other DI frameworks and some limitations:

- Only constructor injection is supported, **no** setter/field injection
- No `PostConstruct` or `PreDestroy`
- Uses some JSR-330 annotations (`javax.inject.*`) but is **not** a compliant implementation of JSR-330
- Java 8 only

If you like to use dependency injection (which is always a good idea) but EasyDI doesn't fit your needs
 you might want to try other DI frameworks like [CDI](http://www.cdi-spec.org/), [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice)
 or [Dagger](https://square.github.io/dagger/).

## Tutorial

In the wiki there is a tutorial where all features of EasyDI are described.
In the example we are creating a coffee machine application:
[wiki](https://github.com/lestard/EasyDI/wiki/Tutorial).

The code for this example is located in the test source directory:
[/src/test/java/eu/lestard/easydi/examples/coffee/](https://github.com/lestard/EasyDI/tree/master/src/test/java/eu/lestard/easydi/examples/coffee)

## Real-World Examples:

- [SnakeFX](https://github.com/lestard/SnakeFX): A Snake clone written in JavaFX
- [Nonogram](https://github.com/lestard/nonogram): A nonogram puzzle game written in JavaFX

## How to Use

### 1. Add the library to your project

There are two ways of using the library in your project:

1. Download the JAR file and add it to the classpath of your project. Additionally you will need [javax.inject](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|javax.inject|javax.inject|1|jar) (can be downloaded from [here](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=javax/inject/javax.inject/1/javax.inject-1.jar))
2. Use a Build-System like Gradle or Maven. **Easy-DI** is available in the Maven Central Repository.
See [Maven dependencies](#dependencies)

### 2. Create your classes

Write your Java classes. When your class needs an instance of another class, simply add this dependency as a constructor parameter.


```java
public class Car {

    private final Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine){
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        engine.accelerate();
    }
}

public class Engine {
    public void start(){
        ...
    }

    public void accelerate(){
        ...
    }
}
```

### 3. Use EasyDI to get instances of your classes

```java
import eu.lestard.easydi.EasyDI;

public class CarApp {

    public static void main(String...args){
        EasyDI easyDI = new EasyDI();

        final Car car = easyDI.getInstance(Car.class);

        car.drive();
    }
}
```

For this simple use case EasyDI doesn't need any annotations or configuration.

## Optional Features

### Multiple Constructors

When a class has more then one public constructor, you need to tell *EasyDI* which one it should use. This is
done with the annotation `javax.inject.Inject`:

```java
public class Car {
    ...
    @Inject
    public Car(Engine engine){
        // this constructor will be used
        ...
    }

    public Car(){
        ...
    }
}
```

### Interfaces and Implementing classes

EasyDI doesn't know which implementing class it should use when an interface type is requested as a dependency.
You have to tell it with the `easyDI.bindInterface(interfaceType, implementingType)` method.

```java
public interface Engine {}

public class GasolineEngine implements Engine {}

public class ElectricMotor implements Engine {}


EasyDI easyDi = new EasyDI();
easyDI.bindInterface(Engine.class, ElectricMotor.class);
...

final Engine engine = easyDI.getInstance(Engine.class);

assertThat(engine).isInstanceOf(ElectricMotor.class);
```

### Singletons

By default EasyDI will create new instances every time a dependency is requested. If you like to have only one
instance of a specific class you have to tell it EasyDI. There are two ways of doing this:

#### 1. @Singleton

The recommended way is to use the `javax.inject.Singleton` annotation on the class that should be a singleton:

```java
@Singleton
public class Car {
...
}
```

#### 2. EasyDI.markAsSingleton()

You can mark a class as singleton with the method `markAsSingleton`. This is useful when you for some reason can't
modify the source code of the class you want to be a singleton (i.e. when it is part of a third-party library).

```java
EasyDI easyDI = new EasyDI();

easyDI.markAsSingleton(ThirdParty.class);
...
```

### Providers

If you like to inject instances of a class that doesn't meet the requirements of EasyDI you can add a `javax.inject.Provider`
for this class. There are many use cases where this can be useful:

- There is only a factory method to get instances of this class but no constructors
- There is no public constructor or there are more than one public constructors and (for some reason) you can't add the `@Inject` annotation
- The class is implemented with the [classical Singleton design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern#Example).
- You need to make some configuration on the created instance before it can be used for injection.
- When you like to use abstract classes as dependency (see next section)

```java
EasyDI easyDI = new EasyDI();

easyDI.bindProvider(Engine.class, new Provider<Engine>() {
    @Override
    public Engine get(){
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        engine.configureThis();
        engine.configureThat();
        return engine;
    }
});
```

With Java 8 lambdas you would write this:

```java
easyDI.bindProvider(Engine.class, ()-> {
    Engine engine = new Engine();
    engine.configureThis();
    engine.configureThat();
    return engine;
});
```


### Abstract classes

If an instance of an abstract class is requested, EasyDI can't know out of
the box which implementing class it should use.

This is the same situation as with interfaces. Unlike interfaces at the moment there is no
explicit way of defining a binding for abstract classes. The reason is that there are
far more possibilities for (miss-)configuration when it comes to (abstract) class bindings.

When you like to use abstract classes as dependencies you will have to [create a provider](#providers) for this class.


### Lazy injection / lazy instantiation

In some use cases you need an instance of a class but at the time your constructor is called
this dependency isn't yet available for some reason or it shouldn't be instantiated at this time.
Instead you like to retrieve the instance at some later point in time.

Another similar use case is when you need a dependency only under some conditions and the construction of the dependency is expensive.

In both cases **lazy injection** is your friend. Easy-DI can do lazy injection like this:

1. change the type of the constructor parameter from `T` to `javax.inject.Provider<T>`
2. call the method `get` on the provider instance when you need the actual instance

Example:

```java

public class Car {

    private Provider<Engine> engineProvider;

    public Car(Provider<Engine> engineProvider){
        this.engineProvider = engineProvider;
    }

    public void buildCar(){
        Engine engine =  engineProvider.get();

        ...
    }
```

In this example the instance of the `Engine` is only created when the `buildCar` method is called. In this
case the normal dependency injection mechanism of Easy-DI with all configuration rules described above
will run and retrieve an instance of `Engine`.

**Recommendation**:
In general lazy injection should only be the last choice when you really can't inject an instance directly in the constructor.
With lazy injection it's likely that it will be harder to reason about your code. It's not trivial anymore to tell at which
point in time an instance of your class will be created.


### Inject EasyDI context

In some use cases you like to have access to the EasyDI instance in one of your
classes to be able to get other instances at runtime.

To achieve this use this config:

```
EasyDI context = new EasyDI();
context.bindProvider(EasyDI.class, ()-> context);
```

Then you can inject `EasyDI` in you classes:


```
Example.java:

public class Example {

    private EasyDI context;

    public Example(EasyDI context){
        this.context = context;
    }

    public void doSomething(){
        Other other = context.getInstance(Other.class);
        ...
    }
}

```


**Be aware that there are some drawbacks/characteristics with this approach you should keep in mind:**

- It's harder to reason about your code because the instantiation of classes may be delayed.
- It may be harder to reason about your EasyDI configuration as it's now possible make configurations in other classes too
- You have a Dependency (`import`) to the EasyDI library in your business code.
This makes it harder to change the dependency library afterwards.
- If you forget the `bindProvider` configuration you will get a new context instance injected everytime as the `EasyDI` class isn't marked as singleton. This has ceveral consequences: 
  - The new instance of EasyDI has no configuration. It's a totally different instance as the root context. NO configuration will be inherited from the root context.
  - The scope of the singleton configuration is limited to a single context. When there are two contexts it's possible that there two instances of a class that was marked as singleton in your application!


**Therefore it's generally not recommended to inject `EasyDÌ` in your classes**. It should only be the last choice when there
is no other option for your use case.

## Note on Circular Dependencies

When using constructor injection without a DI framework, it isn't possible to
create circular dependencies. Look at the following example:

```java
public class A {
    public A (B b){}
}

public class B {
    public B (C c){}
}

public class C {
    public C (A a){}
}
```

You can't instantiate any of these classes with `new` because you can't provide the needed
constructor params (except you pass `null` as constructor param).

The same is true for EasyDI. If you try to get an instance of one of these classes you will
get an `IllegalStageException`:

```java
EasyDI easyDI = new EasyDI();

easyDI.getInstance(A.class); // IllegalStateException
```

Creating circular dependencies is generally a bad idea because it leads to tight coupling.
While other DI frameworks can circumvent this by creating proxy classes, EasyDI won't!
Instead you have to [fix your dependency graph](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/01/circular-dependency-in-constructors-and-dependency-injection/).
